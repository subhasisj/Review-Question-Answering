# Review-Question-Answering


## Introduction
Question-Answering (QA) is a form of natural language processing (NLP) that is used to answer questions. 

## Methods
1. We use Transformer based architectures to answer questions from a given context implementing a QuestionAnsweringPipeline from HuggingFace.

2. We use Retriever-Reader architecture using HayStack to Build a QA system. We will use Elasticsearch as the Document Store for the Retriever.
